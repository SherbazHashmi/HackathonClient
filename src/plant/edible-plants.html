              <div class="description">The macadamia is a small to large tree that bears decorative trusses of cream flowers, followed by edible, nutritious nuts. It naturally occurs in Queensland, but has spread to other parts of the world where it is grown for the nuts.</div>

              <div class="description">Common understorey shrub to 2m tall in or near rainforest or wet sclerophyll forest. White, tiny flowers appearing in summer. Edible orange globular berry ripe May - July. This is a rigid, many-branched spiny shrub liking full sun or shade. Attracts small birds to the garden because its spines protect them from larger birds. Fruit eaten by Wonga pigeon, food plant for Bright Copper butterfly.</div>

              <div class="description">This plant’s ability to thrive in arid environments has imbued its leaves with a saltiness that lends itself to flavouring roast Iamb, seafood, vegetable dishes, casseroles and stews. Saltbush is a hardy plant that requires little watering, and its silvery-grey foliage and pink new growth make it a distinctive, useful and low-maintenance addition to Australian gardens.</div>

              <div class="description">Grown in Africa since the 1990s to help sustain drought-stricken communities, many acacias produce a seed that can be roasted, ground and added to flour to bake breads and cakes. Its nutty taste, reminiscent of hazelnuts, has made it a popular addition to ice-cream, coffee and cheesecake. Several acacia species are used in cooking; however, Acacia victoriae (or elegant wattle) is widely recog-nised as the industry standard.</div>

The leaves are usually dried and then milled or ground; the berries, known as pepper-berries, are dried and crumbled or ground. This medium-sized tree occurs naturally in Tasmania and the wet forests of south-eastern Australia.</div>

              <div class="description">The leaves of this subtropical rainforest plant can be harvested year-round. When dried and milled, they impart a sweet liquorice flavour similar to star anise, and can be used in many of the same foods — such as cakes, biscuits, sauces and curries. Its purple flushes of growth, aromatic white flowers and ease of maintenance make it a popular garden tree.</div>

              <div class="description">This small perennial herb has scented leaves and diminutive, white and lilac flowers. It’s an adaptable and low-maintenance plant and its leaves can be used in much the same way as its exotic counterparts. Aboriginal people used the leaves to treat coughs, colds and stomach ailments. It’s named for its natural occurrence in shady areas near rivers and creeks.</div>

              <div class="description">A word of warning: there are more than 100 Solanum species in Australia, but only a half-dozen are edible — and the unripe fruits of these are toxic. This is a small, arid-zone shrub whose ripe fruits have a savoury, robust flavour similar to sun-dried tomatoes. It is most often dried and ground into a spice for use in casseroles, curries and salsas.</div>
